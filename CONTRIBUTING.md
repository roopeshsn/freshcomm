# Contributing

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Conception and its packages, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

To begin, please check the Issues tab to see where you can contribute.

## Issue Label/Tagging Breakdown

Checking the open issues is a great place to see what's currently being worked on and also what's available to work on. Labels are used to group different issues by status, type, and difficulty. The main labels you should be aware of are:

- react
- bug
- enhancement
- good first issue
- code level easy
- code level medium
- code level hard
- in progress
- ready to work on
- discussion

**To claim an issue to work on please write a comment on the issue letting me know you'd like to take it on. Once the issue has been claimed the 'in progress' label will be added.**

If something doesn't make sense please ask for clarification or assistance by writing a comment on the issue.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR that relates directly to an issue, please write a comment on the relevant issue letting me know you'd like to take it on. Once the issue has been claimed the 'in progress' label will be added. After long periods of inactivity, I'll remove the 'in progress' label so someone else can work on it.

If you've never submitted a pull request before then I would recommend you check out this guide: [Step-by-step guide to contributing on GitHub](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/)

Don't panic if you feel as though your code isn't quite up-to-scratch. This is an opportunity for you to learn and to receive feedback. If your code needs some work then please see this as a positive experience and opportunity to improve.

Pull requests big or small will be accepted, however, if you are submitting a major feature then please make sure you create an issue for discussion before attempting this work, likewise if you spot a bug please raise a new issue before creating a pull request.
